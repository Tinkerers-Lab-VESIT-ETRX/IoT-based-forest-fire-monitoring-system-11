# IoT-based-forest-fire-monitoring-system-11










We have designed complete solution for ‘Forest Fire’. We have use various sensors and gather their reading on microcontroller. We have written a program in Arduino IDE to read the value from the sensors and from the microcontroller we have uploaded data to the ‘firebase’ which is our central database. For the end consumer we have build one Web app to display readings in graphical format. 
The Forest fire conditions like temperature, Humidity and smoke information are transferred to the Firebase. In this way, we are transmitting the real-time environment information. In this way we have manually transmited the real-time forest fire information. Due to uploading in Firebase the information can be viewed from any part of the world. The system will function with tracking and monitoring temperature, humidity and other sensors.
